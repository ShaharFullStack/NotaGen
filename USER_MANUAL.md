## Getting Started

### First Launch

1. **Open LegSynth** in your web browser
2. **Allow camera access** when prompted - this is essential for tracking your legs
3. The camera feed will appear, along with two circular interfaces

### Initial Setup

1. **Position yourself** so your full body is visible in the camera
2. **Stand about 6-10 feet** away from the camera for best results
3. **Click the "Calibrate Position" button** in the control panel
4. **Wait 1 second** while staying still - this sets your center position
5. You're ready to play!

## How to Play

### The Basics

LegSynth uses **two circular interfaces**:

- **Left Circle (Blue)** = Melody Notes
  - Controlled by your **LEFT LEG**
  - Plays individual musical notes

- **Right Circle (Purple)** = Harmony Chords
  - Controlled by your **RIGHT LEG**
  - Plays chord triads (3 notes at once)

### Playing Your First Notes

1. **Move your left leg** to the side, forward, or back
2. Watch the blue circle - a slice will light up
3. A musical note will play!
4. Try the same with your **right leg** to play chords

### Expression Control

The **further you move your leg** from center:
- The **louder** the sound becomes
- The **more intense** the visual glow

This allows for dynamic, expressive playing!

## Understanding the Interface

### Visual Elements

#### 1. **Circular Interfaces**
- Each circle is divided into **8 slices** (like a pizza)
- Each slice represents a different note or chord
- Active slices **glow brighter** when your leg is in them

#### 2. **Leg Markers**
- **Blue dot** = Your left leg position
- **Purple dot** = Your right leg position
- The dots get **bigger and brighter** as you move further from center

#### 3. **Camera Feed**
- Faint background video showing you
- Helps you see your positioning
- Opacity is low so it doesn't distract from the visualization

#### 4. **Status Bar**
- Bottom center of screen
- Shows current status messages
- Displays any errors that occur

---

## Tips & Techniques

### For Beginners

1. **Start with one leg** - Practice with just your left leg first
2. **Use the Pentatonic scale** - It's hard to play wrong notes!
3. **Move slowly** - Give yourself time to hear each note
4. **Calibrate often** - Recalibrate if you change position

### For Advanced Players

1. **Use both legs together** - Create melody + harmony simultaneously
2. **Control dynamics** - Move closer/further to control volume
3. **Experiment with scales** - Each scale has a different mood
4. **Try different presets** - Switch sounds mid-performance

### Movement Techniques

#### Circular Motion
Move your leg in a circle to play ascending/descending patterns

#### Quick Jumps
Jump between distant slices for dramatic interval changes

#### Subtle Shifts
Small movements between adjacent slices for smooth melodies

#### Static Hold
Hold your leg in one position to sustain a note or chord

## Troubleshooting

### "Camera not working"
- **Check permissions** - Make sure you allowed camera access
- **Close other apps** - Other programs might be using your camera
- **Refresh the page** and allow camera access again
- **Check your camera** - Test it in another application

### "Legs not being detected"
- **Improve lighting** - Make sure your room is well-lit
- **Stand further back** - Your full legs need to be visible
- **Wear contrasting colors** - Avoid colors that blend with your floor
- **Recalibrate** - Click "Calibrate Position" again

### "No sound playing"
- **Check your volume** - System and browser volume should be up
- **Click on the page** - Some browsers require user interaction first
- **Check calibration** - You must calibrate before sounds play
- **Move further** - You might need to move your leg more

### "Sound is choppy or delayed"
- **Close other browser tabs** - Free up system resources
- **Reduce video quality** - Move to a location with less detail in the background
- **Refresh the page** - Sometimes helps clear memory
- **Check your computer** - Older devices may struggle with real-time processing

### "Wrong notes playing"
- **Recalibrate your position** - Your center point may have shifted
- **Stand still during calibration** - Movement affects the calibration
- **Check your stance** - Make sure both feet are visible
- **Avoid crossed legs** - Keep legs separated for better tracking

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, all controls are accessible via the control panel on the right side of the screen. Future versions may include keyboard shortcuts.

## Performance Tips

### Lighting

- Avoid backlighting (windows behind you)
- Side lighting works best

### Positioning
- Stand **6-10 feet** from camera
- Keep your **full body visible**
- Use a **plain background** when possible
- Avoid **busy patterns** in the background

### Clothing
- Wear **fitted clothing** for better tracking
- **Contrasting colors** help (not the same color as your floor)
- Avoid **loose, flowing garments** that hide leg movement

---

## Creative Ideas

### Solo Performance
- Use one leg for melody, hold the other still on a chord
- Create rhythmic patterns by moving in and out of slices
- Experiment with different scales for different moods

### Improvisation
- Use Pentatonic or Blues scales for easy improvisation
- Let your body movement guide the music naturally
- Don't overthink - just move and listen!

### Composition
- Plan out which slices to hit in sequence
- Practice specific movements to recreate melodies
- Record your performances (use external recording software)
